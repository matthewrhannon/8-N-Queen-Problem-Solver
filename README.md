# 8-N-Queen-Problem-Solver
implementation of the 8-Queen problem where the user places 8 different queens on the board and the algorithm solves in the least number of iterations possible to have none of the queens attacking each other. Code supports N-Queens problem as well.

The 8 Queens Problem is a classic puzzle that involves placing eight queens (or in this implementation NxN queens is supported) on a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens should be placed on the same row, column, or diagonal.
This program offers the user the ability to place 8 different queens anywhere they want on the chess board and this program will find the quickest iteration of queen movements that it would take to find a valid solution (there are 92 solutions for 8x8 board size) that satisfies the 8 Queen Problems.
